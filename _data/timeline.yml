  description: Throughout my time at Cloudreach, I’ve had the opportunity to work on an extensive and varied portfolio 
               of projects for multiple FTSE 100 companies and government entities. Whilst on these engagements, I’ve 
               been heavily involved in the design, development, management and governance of the solutions that we were 
               brought in to deliver. With respect to the solutions themselves, these have ranged from an AWS Landing 
               Zone platform for a national financial regulator to an EV charging frontend platform for a multinational 
               energy provider.

  description: Building on from my previous role, this position was where I was really able to focus on improving my 
               technical leadership and people management skills. Throughout my time in this position, I was the 
               technical lead for multiple customer engagements ranging from Landing Zone platforms to Application 
               Migrations and Modernisations. In addition to work on customer engagements, I was also responsible for 
               managing a team of engineers within Cloudreach, specifically in career growth. All in all, this was a 
               multidisciplinary role, with a focus on depth of technical knowledge, people management, both internally 
               and on customer engagements, as well as having a broad understanding of organisational requirements and 
               challenges.

  description: Having joined Cloudreach through their graduate programme, this role was pivotal in building my 
               foundational industry experience. I was fortunate enough to have worked on high profile customer 
               engagements such as with a national financial regulator and a multinational insurance provider. Both of 
               which were at an early stage in their cloud adoption, which provided me with the opportunity to really 
               experience the challenges of not only migrating to the Cloud, but also to really understand and be able 
               justify that move, both in terms of the technology and the cultural shift within an organisation that 
               comes with it. On the whole, this role provided me with a strong foundational technological understanding 
               in the Cloud space, as well as a broad understanding of managing technology within large organisations.
