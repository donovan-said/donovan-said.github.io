  description: Throughout my time at Cloudreach, I’ve had the opportunity to work on an extensive and varied portfolio 
               of projects for multiple FTSE 100 companies and government entities. Whilst on these engagements, I’ve 
               been heavily involved in the design, development, management and governance of the solutions that we were 
               brought in to deliver. With respect to the solutions themselves, these have ranged from an AWS Landing 
               Zone platform for a national financial regulator to an EV charging frontend platform for a multinational 
               energy provider.
